I am a Teaching and Research Associate at the Institute for Retailing & Data Science and a PhD Student in Economics and Social Sciences at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.
<br>
My research interests encompass Quantitative Marketing, Platform Economics, Human Brand Scandals, Pro-Social Behavior, and Emerging Technologies. My research delves into the impact of various stakeholders on the music industry, including streaming and social media platforms, activist groups, and innovations in content delivery and promotion. Furthermore, I am actively exploring recent advancements in applied econometrics, such as novel difference-in-differences estimators and integrating machine learning with traditional econometric models.
