I explore how key stakeholders—such as streaming platforms, social media, activist groups, and technological innovations in content delivery and promotion—affect the dynamics of the music industry. \nMethodologically, I am interested in advancing applied econometrics, particularly in developing new difference-in-differences estimators and integrating machine learning with traditional econometric techniques.\n\nCurriculum Vitae"
